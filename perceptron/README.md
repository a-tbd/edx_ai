Perceptron Learning Algorithm
Input: CSV set of linearly seperable datapoints (x, y, classification)
Output: CSV set of weights for each datapoint (w_1, w_2, bias)

Sample input and output data included in the startercode folder.

The Perceptron class also produces a visualization of the resulting decision boundary at each step.
